## Introduction

This project, "Campus Ride-Sharing Platform with Parking System Integration," aims to develop a comprehensive mobile and web application designed to address the commuting and parking challenges faced by students, faculty, and staff at Multimedia University (MMU). The platform will facilitate ride-sharing among campus users and integrate with the campus parking system to provide real-time availability and reservation capabilities.

## Project Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to:

* **Alleviate** Commuting **and Parking Challenges:** Tackle persistent issues of traffic congestion and parking scarcity on campus.

* **Streamline Commuting Experience:** Provide real-time parking availability and intelligent ride-matching.

* **Promote Sustainability:** Reduce the number of individual vehicles on campus, thereby lowering greenhouse gas emissions and the campus's carbon footprint.

* **Enhance User Experience:** Offer an accessible, secure, and intuitive application for all campus members.

* **Foster a Connected Campus:** Strengthen the sense of community by facilitating shared transportation.

* **Support Strategic Objectives:** Align with the university's goals of innovation, engagement, and environmental stewardship.

## Scope

The project scope includes the development of:

* **Dual-Platform Solution:**

  * A mobile application (iOS and Android) for students and staff.

  * A web platform with a user-facing portal and an administrative backend.

* **Core** Ride-Sharing **Functionalities:**

  * Secure user registration (MMU credentials, digital ID verification, MFA).

  * Profile management.

  * Geolocation, route optimization, and real-time vehicle tracking (ETAs).

  * Flexible ride scheduling (advance and instant) with easy cancellation/rescheduling.

  * In-app communication (chat/call) and push notifications.

  * Automated, dynamic fare estimation and transparent cost-splitting.

  * Integration of diverse digital payment methods (campus billing, e-wallets, potential cash toggle).

  * Detailed trip/payment histories.

  * Two-way rating and feedback system.

* **Integrated Parking Management Functionalities:**

  * Real-time parking lot occupancy display (integration with campus sensor/gate systems).

  * Parking spot reservation (potentially linked with ride-sharing).

  * Automated campus gate entry/exit (RFID or license-plate recognition).

  * Digital parking permits.

  * Dynamic parking fees based on demand.

  * Incentives for ride-sharing participants.

* **Safety and Security Features:**

  * In-app safety tools (SOS button, trip sharing).

  * Robust driver and vehicle verification (profile displays, background screening, vehicle cross-checking).

* **Administrative Web Platform:**

  * Centralized dashboard for system oversight.

  * Detailed reporting and analytics.

  * User role, policy, and pricing management tools.

  * System maintenance alerts.

  * Digital permit management and citation workflow integration.

* **Non-Functional Requirements:**

  * High performance, availability, and reliability.

  * Intuitive design and accessibility compliance.

  * Robust security measures.

  * Consistent brand identity.

  * Responsive interface.
